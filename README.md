This is part of a course named 50 Projects In 50 Days - I made a little tweak and all of the miniprojects are done with either react or nextjs, plus typescript and tailwindcss

In order to run this project you just need to type:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
